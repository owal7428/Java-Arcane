The only thing that actually deviated from the original UML diagram when implementing was the observer pattern.
I initially didn't have an interface for the subject, but that is something that I did in the end implement because it
made the code more organized and a bit simpler than it otherwise would've been. Besides that, basically everything else stayed
the same as the original UML diagram.
